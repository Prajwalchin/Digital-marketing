        <h1>Indroduction to e-commerce</h1>
        <p>E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods and services online. It is the process of conducting commercial transactions through the internet, allowing customers to shop and purchase products from the comfort of their own homes or anywhere with internet access.

            <br> E-commerce transactions can take various forms, including business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-consumer (C2C), and consumer-to-business (C2B). B2B e-commerce involves transactions between businesses, while B2C e-commerce involves transactions between businesses and consumers. C2C e-commerce involves transactions between consumers, such as through online marketplaces or auction sites. C2B e-commerce involves transactions where consumers sell goods or services to businesses.
            
            <br> E-commerce has become increasingly popular due to its convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. It offers customers the ability to shop anytime and anywhere, without the limitations of physical store hours or geographic location. E-commerce also allows businesses to reach a wider audience and reduce overhead costs associated with operating a physical store.
            
            <br>  In summary, e-commerce is the process of buying and selling goods and services online, through electronic transactions. It offers numerous benefits to both businesses and customers, making it an essential part of the modern economy.</p>
